### Getting started with GitHub

 1. [Sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) using your work e-mail with `drc-<your DRC username>` as your username
 2. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
 3. Optionally, you can also install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (I prefer Git Bash to Git Shell, but that's just me)
 4. Contact [Dave Moos](https://github.com/davemoos) and ask to be added to the Psychometrics GitHub team
